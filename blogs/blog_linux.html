            <p>In the world of visual effects (VFX), where creativity meets technical innovation, Linux has established itself as the go-to operating system for both local and cloud-based systems. Its versatility, performance, and developer-friendly nature have made it a cornerstone for studios seeking efficiency and scalability in an increasingly competitive industry. From powering local workstations to orchestrating complex cloud infrastructures, Linux plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of VFX production.</p>
            <h2>Why Linux Dominates in the VFX Industry</h2>
            <p>Deadline Cloud is a flexible and scalable render management system provided by AWS Thinkbox. It seamlessly integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to offer studios the ability to harness massive computing power on demand. Unlike traditional render farms that require significant upfront investment and maintenance, Deadline Cloud allows studios to scale their rendering capacity dynamically, only paying for what they use.</p>
