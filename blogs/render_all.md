<h2>What is Render All?</h2>
<p>
    Render All! is a lightweight application designed to simplify the rendering process for Nuke projects. Built for both 
    <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong> users (with plans for macOS in the future), it empowers artists and 
    technical directors (TDs) to queue multiple Nuke files, automate rendering tasks, and ensure their renders are completed 
    efficiently without manual intervention.
</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>User-Friendly Queue System:</strong> The core of Render All! lies in its easy-to-use queue, allowing you to add, organize, 
        and manage <code>.nk</code> files seamlessly. Whether you're rendering one script or dozens, the process is straightforward.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Flexible File Management:</strong> Adding files to the render queue can be done in three ways:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Drag and Drop:</strong> Simply drag <code>.nk</code> files into the queue.</li>
            <li><strong>File Browser:</strong> Use the intuitive '+' button to locate and select files.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Integration (Coming Soon):</strong> A planned feature will let you load scripts directly from a database plugin integrated with Nuke.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customizable Write Node Selection:</strong> By specifying the exact name of the Write node to be rendered, users can 
        maintain consistency across scripts. The tool defaults to rendering <code>Write1</code>, but naming conventions can be adjusted as needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Convenient Automation Options:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open Folder After Render:</strong> Automatically open the folder containing finished renders.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Shutdown:</strong> Once the render queue is completed, the program can shut down the computer after a 10-minute delay, saving energy and time.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Error Handling and Stoppage:</strong> If errors occur or you need to interrupt the process, Render All! lets you stop rendering at any time, immediately terminating the process.
    </li>
</ul>
